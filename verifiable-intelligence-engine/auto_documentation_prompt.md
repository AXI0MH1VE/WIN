# Autonomous Documentation Generation Prompt for Verifiable Intelligence Engine

You are assisting with documentation and proof of functionality for a production anomaly detection backend. The goal is to demonstrate, with fact-based artifacts, that a real, advanced API and model system is running, ready for demo or external review.

Complete these tasks:

## System Overview

- Summarize what the “Verifiable Intelligence Engine Anomaly Detection Core” does, including its main claims (anomaly detection, empirical verifiability scoring, GDPR/eIDAS 2.0 compliant).
- Reference that it is operational at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).

## API Evidence

- Embed (or simulate) sanitized screenshots of the Swagger UI, proving the presence of:
  - /train-model endpoint
  - /detect-anomalies endpoint
  - /health endpoint
  - /model-status/{model_id} endpoint

- For each, document:
  - Example request/response JSON shown in the Swagger examples
  - A short explanation of what each endpoint does and required fields.

## Live System Proof

- Run a health check via the /health endpoint (or show/apply the example response from Swagger).
- GET the status for model_id default_model via /model-status/default_model and display the output, highlighting is_trained, data_shape, or relevant status fields.

## Model/Benchmarks

- Use the example request body for /train-model to show how training data is sent.
- Use the example request body for /detect-anomalies to show how sample inference works.
- (Optional) If possible, run these requests interactively; if not, use example schemas with a note.
- If real timing, scores, or benchmark metrics can be provided, generate and present a results table using the outputs from the running API (or note these are representative if not live-executable).

## Summary/Verification

- Clearly state: “All content shown above is verifiable in a local browser session at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) and matches a running instance of the actual codebase.”
- Optionally, hash or timestamp request/response artifacts for extra integrity.

## Instructions

- Keep all output strictly technical and fact-based; avoid hype and marketing language.
- Redact or omit any internal secret details or proprietary structures not critical for proof.
- Ensure every code sample, screenshot, or output is directly derived from the active API instance.

## Goal

Generate a single PDF or notebook artifact—or a well-formatted Markdown report—containing all the above, so the owner can confidently relax knowing everything needed for proof and verification is automatically assembled.
